## Call chain

System entry point (no upstream callers traced)

## Spec (LLM-generated)

**Precondition:** `requires (null(file) || valid(file)) && (size == 0 || valid_range(buf, 0, size)) && (size <= 2147483647) && (!null(file) && file->type == 1 implies (valid(file->data) || null(file->data)))`

**Postcondition:** `ensures (esult == (int)size) || (esult == -1) && ((esult == -1) implies (null(file) || file->type != 1 || allocation failure or I/O error occurred)) && ((esult == (int)size) implies the data in buf[0..size) has been appended to the file's existing content)`

## Root cause

CBMC reports a `vfs_append.pointer_dereference.99` failure — a memory-safety violation in `vfs_append`.

**Realism checker's key concern:** The specific witness requires a vfs_node_t with an astronomically large `file->size` and invalid `file->data` simultaneously — this combination is a CBMC symbolic extreme, not a realistic initialized struct state. However, the integer overflow path in `file->size + size` and the lack of bounds checking on `file->data` relative to `file->size` represent a real (if harder to trigger) vulnerability class for attacker-controlled inputs.

**Validator reasoning:** 'vfs_append' is an entry function (no callers in any file). The counterexample is directly reachable from the system boundary.

## How to trigger

`vfs_append` is reachable as a system-entry point — call it directly with the counterexample's variable assignments.

## Realism assessment

**Verdict:** UNCERTAIN (medium confidence)

**Key concern:** The specific witness requires a vfs_node_t with an astronomically large `file->size` and invalid `file->data` simultaneously — this combination is a CBMC symbolic extreme, not a realistic initialized struct state. However, the integer overflow path in `file->size + size` and the lack of bounds checking on `file->data` relative to `file->size` represent a real (if harder to trigger) vulnerability class for attacker-controlled inputs.

Q1 (Can the violation TYPE occur?): Yes. In the non-FAT32 path, when `new_size > file->capacity`, the code allocates `new_cap = new_size + 64` bytes, then calls `memcpy(new_data, file->data, file->size)` if `file->data` is non-null. Two real vulnerability classes exist here: (a) if `file->size` is large enough that `file->size + size` integer-overflows (size_t wraparound), `new_size` becomes small, malloc succeeds, and the subsequent memcpy reads far beyond the actual allocated `file->data` buffer; (b) if `file->size` is inconsistent with the actual allocation backing `file->data`, the memcpy over-reads. Since this is a public API with no callers guarding input validity, an attacker who can construct a malicious `vfs_node_t` (or cause memory corruption elsewhere) could trigger this. Q2 (Is this specific witness realistic?): The specific counterexample has `file->size = 16120114370612188845ul` (effectively a garbage/uninitialized value) with `file->data` unknown, and `size = 0`. This is a CBMC symbolic artifact — in real execution, `vfs_node_t` structs are initialized with `size=0, data=NULL` (per `create_mem_file`), so a legitimate node would not have a huge `size` with invalid `data`. However, the global context confirms `size` and `data` are set in separate operations, leaving a window for inconsistency. The integer overflow path (`file->size + size` wrapping) is the more realistic attack vector but requires `size` (a function argument, not `file->size`) to be near `SIZE_MAX`. The dynamic harness did not trigger, consistent with the witness being a CBMC artifact rather than a directly reproducible case.

## Manual review checklist

- [ ] Confirm the call chain is reachable in the actual VibeOS codebase
- [ ] Verify the counterexample variable assignments are achievable at runtime
- [ ] Check whether a fix is already present in a newer version
- [ ] Assess exploitability severity (crash-only / memory corruption / arbitrary write)
- [ ] File upstream issue if confirmed
